            <p>The website “Hanslick Online” provides the writings of Eduard Hanslick (1825–1904), a
               central figure of nineteenth-century music, who acted as an aesthetic theorist, music
               critic, and the first professor for the “History and Aesthetics of Musical Art” in
               German-language academia. It presents findings of several third-party-funded
               projects, in which <ref
                  target="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7568-3737">Christoph Landerer</ref> and <ref target="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0117-3574">Alexander Wilfing</ref> have been exploring the
               historical contexts of Hanslick and his works since 2014.</p>
            <p>Particular attention is paid to the numerous adaptations these texts have went
               through during Hanslick’s lifetime. Besides making these texts (as of now, <ref
                  target="t__01_VMS_1854_TEI_AW_26-01-21-TEI-P5.html?lang=en"
                     ><emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph></ref> and Hanslick’s writings for the
                  <emph>Neue Freie
                     Presse</emph> [in development]) publicly available, “Hanslick Online” also 
               facilitates
               automated 
               comparisons between textual variants. The website thereby fills a gap in
               Hanslick scholarship, which is currently focusing more and more on the dynamic
               evolution and fluctuation of Hanslick’s mindset.</p>
            <p>The drop-down menu “project” gives a brief sketch of <ref
               target="bedeutung-hanslick-engl.html">Hanslick’s historical relevance</ref> from
               the nineteenth century to the present, explains the <ref
                  target="projektziele-engl.html">intention and purpose</ref> of the present
               website, and recounts the <ref target="projektgeschichte-engl.html">sequence of
                  research projects</ref>, the results of which led to the preparation of “Hanslick
               Online.” Their scholarly outcome is to be viewed under the subheading “activities”
               (<ref target="publikationen-engl.html">publications</ref>, <ref
                     target="einzelvortraege-engl.html">presentations</ref>, and <ref
                     target="veranstaltungen-engl.html">events</ref>).</p>
            <p>Under the drop-down menu “edition,” you will find the <ref
               target="t__01_VMS_1854_TEI_AW_26-01-21-TEI-P5.html?lang=en"
                  >10 editions</ref> of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> and the option to
               compare between variants of your choice by means of automated collation. By the end
               of 2025, Hanslick’s
                  writings for the <emph>Neue Freie Presse</emph> (1864–1904) will also be
               published, including TEI markup (in development). As a capstone of the project series, we are
               currently preparing a closing project providing Hanslick’s remaining writings as part
               of our digital edition and visualizing the connections between these texts. </p>
            <p>“Hanslick Online” is a work in progress, which we intend to expand in terms of
               content and digital functions in the coming years. If you have any suggestions for
               optimizing the digital edition and the website, or questions regarding Hanslick, the
               projects, and their scholarly outcome, please contact us by using the contact details
               provided under “<ref target="team-engl.html">team</ref>.”</p>
