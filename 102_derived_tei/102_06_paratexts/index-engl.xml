            <p>The website “Hanslick Online” provides the writings of Eduard Hanslick (1825–1904), a
               central figure of nineteenth-century music, who acted as an aesthetic theorist, music
               critic, and the first professor for the “History and Aesthetics of Musical Art” in
               German-language academia. It presents findings of several third-party-funded
               projects, in which Christoph Landerer and Alexander Wilfing have been exploring the
               historical contexts of Hanslick and his works since 2014.</p>
            <p>Particular attention is paid to the numerous adaptations these texts have went
               through during Hanslick’s lifetime. Besides making these texts (as of now, <ref
                  target="https://hanslick-online.github.io/hsl-app/t__01_VMS_1854_TEI_AW_26-01-21-TEI-P5.html?prs=off&amp;plc=off&amp;wrk=off&amp;pbs=off&amp;fs=default&amp;ff=default&amp;img=on"

                  <ref target="https://hanslick-online.github.io/hsl-app/toc.html"><emph>Neue Freie
                     Presse</emph></ref>) publicly available, “Hanslick Online” also 
               facilitates
               automated 
               comparisons between textual variants. The website thereby fills a gap in
               Hanslick scholarship, which is currently focusing more and more on the dynamic
               evolution and fluctuation of Hanslick’s mindset.</p>
            <p>The drop-down menu “project” gives a brief sketch of <ref
                  target="bedeutung-hanslick.html">Hanslick’s historical relevance</ref> from
               the nineteenth century to the present, explains the <ref
                  target="projektziele.html">intention and purpose</ref> of the present
               website, and recounts the <ref target="projektgeschichte.html">sequence of
                  research projects</ref>, the results of which led to the preparation of “Hanslick
               Online.” Their scholarly outcome is to be viewed under the subheading “activities”
                  (<ref target="publikationen.html">publications</ref>, <ref
                  target="einzelvortraege.html">presentations</ref>, and <ref
                  target="veranstaltungen.html">events</ref>).</p>

                  >10 editions</ref> of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> and the option to
               compare between variants of your choice by means of automated collation. By the end
               of 2025, <ref target="https://hanslick-online.github.io/hsl-app/toc.html">Hanslick’s
                  writings</ref> for the <emph>Neue Freie Presse</emph> (1864–1904) will also be
               published, including TEI markup. As a capstone of the project series, we are
               currently preparing a closing project providing Hanslick’s remaining writings as part
               of our digital edition and visualizing the connections between these texts. </p>
            
            
            <p>“Hanslick Online” is a work in progress, which we intend to expand in terms of content 
               and digital functions in the coming years.
