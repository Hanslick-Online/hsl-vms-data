            <p>The website “Hanslick Online” provides the writings of Eduard Hanslick (1825–1904), a
               central figure of nineteenth-century music, who acted as an aesthetic theorist, music
               critic, and the first professor for the “History and Aesthetics of Musical Art” in
               German-language academia. It presents findings of several third-party-funded
               projects, in which <ref
                  target="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7568-3737">Christoph Landerer</ref> and <ref target="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0117-3574">Alexander Wilfing</ref> have been exploring the
               historical contexts of Hanslick and his works since 2014.</p>
            <p>Particular attention is paid to the numerous adaptations these texts have gone
               through during Hanslick’s lifetime. Besides making these texts (as of 2025, 1. <ref
                  target="toc_t.html"><emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph></ref>, 2. Hanslick’s
               writings for the <ref target="toc.html"><emph>Neue Freie Presse</emph></ref>, 3. <ref
                  target="toc_vms.html">reviews</ref> of the initial edition of <emph>Vom
                  Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>, and 4. documents on <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> and
               <ref target="toc_doc.html">Hanslick’s professorship</ref>) publicly available, “Hanslick Online” also facilitates
               automated comparisons between textual variants. The website thereby fills a gap in
               Hanslick scholarship, which is currently focusing more and more on the dynamic
               evolution and fluctuation of Hanslick’s mindset.</p>
            <p>The “Project” drop-down menu provides a brief sketch of <ref
                  target="bedeutung-hanslick-engl.html?lang=en">Hanslick’s historical
                  relevance</ref> from the nineteenth century to the present (including a catalogue
               of his publication with hyperlinks to digital copies, and translations of his
               aesthetic treatise), explains the <ref target="projektziele-engl.html?lang=en"
                  >intention and purpose</ref> of the present website, and recounts the <ref
                  target="projektgeschichte-engl.html?lang=en">sequence of research projects</ref>,
               the results of which led to the preparation of “Hanslick Online.” The scholarly
               outcome of these research projects may be viewed under the “Activities” subheading
                  (<ref target="publikationen-engl.html?lang=en">publications</ref>, <ref
                  target="einzelvortraege-engl.html?lang=en">presentations</ref>, and <ref
                  target="veranstaltungen-engl.html?lang=en">events</ref>).</p>
            <p>Under the “Edition” drop-down menu, you will find the <ref target="toc_t.html">ten
                  editions of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph></ref> and the option to compare
               variants by means of automated collation. Here, you can also find Hanslick’s <ref
                  target="toc.html">writings for the <emph>Neue Freie Presse</emph></ref> (ongoing
               publication finished by the end of 2026), the <ref target="toc_vms.html">reviews of
                     <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph></ref>, and <ref target="toc_doc.html"
                  >documents on <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph></ref>, including TEI markup. As
               the culmination of the project series, a closing project has been granted in late
               2024 that will fund both a commentary of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> and the
               visualization of various textual properties.</p>
            <p>“Hanslick Online” is a work in progress, which we intend to expand in terms of
               content and digital functions in the not too distant future. If you have any ideas or
               suggestions for optimizing the digital edition and the website, or questions
               regarding Hanslick, the projects, and their scholarly outcome, please contact us via
               the contact details provided under “<ref target="team-engl.html?lang=en">Team</ref>.”
               Advice on errors or gaps in our data sets are especially welcome!</p>
