            <p>As of the end of 2024, the website “Hanslick Online” provides three distinct textual
               corpora related to Eduard Hanslick:<list>

            <p>The editions were / are led by Alexander Wilfing, with Daniel Elsner and (since 2025)
               Fernando Sanz-Lázaro overseeing their technical realization. The logo of “Hanslick
               Online” was designed by Olivia Reichl. David Heyde proofread the English version of
               explanatory texts in 2023. The recommended format of citation for each text corpus is

               <byline>Alexander Wilfing and Meike Wilfing-Albrecht, 2023</byline>
               <p>This edition is based on the ten versions of Eduard Hanslick’s aesthetic treatise
                     <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen: Ein Beitrag zur Revision der Ästhetik der
                     Tonkunst</emph> (<emph>On the Musically Beautiful: A Contribution towards the
                     Revision of the Aesthetics of Music</emph>), published between 1854 and 1902 in
                  occasionally revised textual versions. Whereas editions 1 to 3 (1854–1865) were
                  published by Rudolph Weigel (Leipzig), Johann Ambrosius Barth (Leipzig) produced
                  the treatise from edition 4 onward (1874–1902). Other sources, like sketches,
                  setting copies, proof copies, etc., are no longer known today, since Hanslick’s
                  estate was lost during the Second World War. The printed copies are thus the only
                  available templates for our digital edition. The articles or chapters from which
                  this treatise presumably originates, some of which were published in advance (see
                  the first two entries under “<ref target="bedeutung-hanslick-engl.html?lang=en"
                     >Eduard Hanslick’s Writings</ref>”), did not figure into this edition. (They
                  will be provided as part of a newly granted research project.)</p>
               <p>The editions of the original treatise—transcribed and corrected by Meike
                  Wilfing-Albrecht—are reproduced as faithfully as possible; the spelling is
                  retained. Errors that were corrected by Hanslick himself within the editions—e.g.,
                  the change from “psychisch” (psychic) to “physisch” (physical), 2.13, from edition
                  9 onward—are also reproduced faithfully. Only evident errata (e.g., “Mnsik”
                  instead of “Musik,” 5.6, in edition 3) have been corrected without indication.
                  Paragraphs are maintained (except for in poems), and changes between editions are
                  indicated by the following markers: contraction → &amp;; subdivision → a and b;
                  addition → 3rd decimal place; deletion → number gap. A revised collation feature
                  is currently being developed. Page numbers and breaks can either be shown or
                  masked via the “Annotations” menu. Verse breaks are indicated by slashes /. We
                  have converted the footnotes to endnotes with jump marks and numbered them
                  consecutively instead of using the original asterisks * to provide a more precise
                  attribution. Up to edition 7, the headings of individual chapters were only
                  displayed in the table of contents. For purposes of manageable navigation, we have
                  incorporated them into the transcription of editions 1–7.</p>
               <p>The printed copies of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> contain several fonts,
                  the meticulous reproduction of which, however, did not seem sensible for a digital
                  edition. The German main text is set in Fraktur script throughout, while Latin,
                  French, Italian, or English passages are usually produced in Latin typeface
                  (especially prominent in the extended original French quotation in 2.43, but also,
                  for example, in “Dr.” on the title page). Since this difference in typeface has no
                  semantic relevance, the present edition refrains from any respective visual
                  demarcation. Text passages formatted in bold face, however, are reproduced
                  according to the templates (cf. 1.31). In the original, moreover, textual emphases
                  are marked with spaced letters, which have been turned into italics for our online
                  edition.</p>
               <p>Whereas the facsimiles of editions 1 and 4–10 were digitized and prepared by
                  Alexander Wilfing and Mehmet Emir, the <ref
                     target="https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/de">MDZ</ref> provides premium
                  digital copies of editions 2 and 3. The music examples shown in chapters 2.19,
                  2.25 and 2.28 (edition 1), as well as 2.19 and 2.17 (editions 2–10), have been
                  typeset anew and arranged according to the original template by our colleague
                  Vasiliki Papadopoulou, for which we thank her sincerely. Only the bracket breaks
                  diverge from the original, as they are only due to the smaller printing format of
                  the respective hard copy and thus have no semantic validity. Hanslick probably had
                  the musical examples set for this specific purpose, but their print templates are
                  not known either. In the example of Christoph Willibald Gluck’s “Che farò” (2.27,
                  from edition 2 onward), the deviations in syllable division between editions are
                  not indicated separately. These can be checked against the respective facsimile
                  reproduction.</p>

                     >Neue Freie Presse</hi> and the reviews of the initial edition of <emph>Vom
                     Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> for the most part match those specified for his
                  aesthetic treatise. They thus will only be defined insofar as they differ from the
                  principles explicated above. Footnotes, for example, are indicated by asterisks *
                  according to the original template, since they occur only rarely and, compared to
                     <hi rend="italic">Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</hi>, as part of shorter essays. </p>
               <p>For now, the edition is based on Hanslick’s extensive feuilletons “below the
                  line,” clearly marked by the initials “Ed. H.,” from 1864 onward, the founding
                  year of <hi rend="italic">Neue Freie Presse</hi>, to 1904, the year of his death.
                  These texts (about 900 items) typically appear in 3 columns on the first 2–3 pages
                  of an issue. Other music-related writings contained in <hi rend="italic">Neue
                     Freie Presse</hi> will then follow, provided Hanslick can be reasonably
                  considered to have authored them. Alexander Wilfing initially created a register
                  of these texts in 2011 as part of Christoph Landerer’s research project
                  “Nietzsche’s Reception of Hanslick” via <ref target="https://anno.onb.ac.at/"
                     >ANNO</ref>, which he later expanded significantly. The digital copies we
                  provide in addition to the TEI/XML text are also obtained from <ref
                     target="https://anno.onb.ac.at/">ANNO</ref> (Austrian Newspaper Online). For
                  practical reasons, team members work simultaneously to produce edited reviews in
                  both ascending and descending chronological order.</p>
               <p>Wilfing also identified the 26 reviews of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>
                  through various repositories (<ref target="https://anno.onb.ac.at/">ANNO</ref>,
                     <ref target="https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/newspaper">DZP</ref>,
                     <ref target="https://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</ref>, etc.) and the appendix of
                  Mark Evan Bonds’s <emph>Absolute Music: The History of an Idea</emph> (Oxford:
                  Oxford University Press, 2014), 301–307. These reviews were published between 1854
                  and the end of 1857, when the second edition of Hanslick’s aesthetic treatise was
                  released, judging by an advertisement in the <hi rend="italic">Börsenblatt für den
                     Deutschen Buchhandel</hi> (<ref

               <p>The TEI annotation of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> was provided by
                  Alexander Wilfing, who oversaw the entire edition process. For the edition of
                  Hanslick’s writings for the <emph>Neue Freie Presse</emph>, Wilfing was assisted
                  by Katharina Bamer and Anna-Maria Pfiel (2022–2024), the latter also being
                  responsible for transcribing and annotating the reviews of the initial edition of
                     <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>. While the XML/TEI files for the ten
                  editions of Hanslick’s aesthetic treatise were generated from Word files, the
                  project members transcribes, proofread, and annotation the other texts with the
                  help of <ref target="https://www.transkribus.org/en">Transkribus</ref>. Formatting
                  and editorial finishing touches were carried out via the XML editor <ref
                     target="https://www.oxygenxml.com/">Oxygen</ref>. Information pertaining to
                  named entities is collected, interlinked, and referenced via a custom <ref
                     target="https://baserow.io/">Baserow</ref> database. The digital edition is
                  built on the “<ref

               <p>Given the sizable volume of texts—amounting to circa 2,000,000 words—the
                  annotation is initially limited to (historical and fictional) people, works
                  (music, texts, images), and places. Additional categories of named entities, such
                  as buildings, groups, and events, may be added in coming project phases. Users can
                  toggle the display of all or individual entity categories via the “Annotations”
                  menu. When activated, the annotations are displayed as icons, with colors that
                  correspond to the entity types listed in said menu. Clicking on an icon presents
                  essential information about the entity, while more detailed data is available via
                  the “Weitere Details” link. These detail view pages can be reached either directly
                  from the icons or through the indexes of persons, places, and works, offering both

                        are included. The remaining datasets (<ref target="https://lobid.org/gnd"
                           >GND</ref>, classification, geographical coordinates, etc.) are
                        automatically queried and added through a pipeline from the GeoNames and
                        Wikidata API, designed by Daniel Elsner. All names of people, works, and
                        places are transliterated into Latin script, and a “Überprüft” (“checked”)
                        tag indicates whether the data has been double-checked.</item>
                     <item>For fictional characters, both their original names and those used by
                        Hanslick are listed, and all figures are linked to the relevant work entry.
                        We however avoid multiple links: for example, there are six separate
                        entities named “Faust” from works by Berlioz, Boito, Goethe, Gounod, Spohr,
                        and Schumann. This principle allows for greater transparency in the
                        statistical evaluation of mentions of named entities. For deities and
                        mythological characters mentioned independently of works, available standard
                        identifiers (<ref target="https://lobid.org/gnd">GND</ref> and <ref
                           target="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page">Wikidata</ref>)
                        are included where available.</item>
                     <item>For historical characters, we record the spelling according to <ref
                           target="https://lobid.org/gnd">GND</ref> and include Hanslick’s variants.
                        In addition, life data and a maximum of three occupations, functions, or
                        activities are entered manually. Birthdates and professional descriptions
                        are drawn (where available) from widely used encyclopedias such as <ref

                           target="https://pmb.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/">PMB</ref>) are automatically
                        queried and added through a pipeline from the Wikidata API. The project
                        members cannot guarantee the correctness of automatically integrated
                        datasets.</item>
                     <item>For works, we follow a similar method, giving both the original headings
                        and those used by Hanslick. Works are linked to their creator(s) and figures
                        named by Hanslick; parts of works are further linked to the main work.
                        However, only autonomous parts of works (e.g., a song from a cycle) are
                        recorded separately; movements from a violin sonata and the like are linked
                        to the entire sonata in cases when such a link is required for unambiguous
                        identification. For song cycles, up to three poets are listed separately;
                        otherwise, we merely credit the composer. Additional datasets include <ref
                           target="https://lobid.org/gnd">GND</ref> numbers and links to open access
                        digital copies (<ref target="https://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page">IMSLP</ref>,
                           <ref target="https://www.digitale-sammlungen.de/">MDZ</ref>, <ref

                        is available). </item>
                  </list></p>
               <p>The main goal of the review project is to produce a digital edition of Hanslick’s
                  writings for the <emph>Neue Freie Presse</emph> to address specific <ref
                     target="https://hanslick.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/projektziele-engl.html?lang=en"
                     >research questions</ref>. Due to resource constraints, the efforts to identify
                  every person and work had to be limited. If a named entity cannot be definitively
                  identified, it is marked with the note “unklarer Bezug” (unclear reference).
                  Ambiguous indications of works—as in the case of, for example, Schubert’s
                  “A-Moll-Sonate” (Sonata in A minor), which Hanslick mentions on December 1, 1864,
                  without further clarification of which piano sonata he is currently speaking
                  (D537, D784, or D845)—are indicated through multiple linked entities, up to a
                  maximum of five links. Feedback on errors and data gaps is always welcome!</p>
               <p>The listing of spelling variants for names and works ensures that a user can, for
                  example, successfully search the index for Niccolò Piccinni, whom Hanslick at
                  times spells “Picinni” and “Piccini,” or Offenbach’s <hi rend="italic">Les
                     Géorgiennes</hi>, which he names “Die Georgierinnern,” “Die schönen
                  Georgierinnen,” and “Die schönen Weiber von Georgien,” respectively. In the case
                  of names and places, only names and places themselves and terms directly related
                  to them are marked, not groups of people that have such references. For example,
                  “Griechenland” and “griechisch” are annotated, “Griechen,” however, are not, which
                  then also applies to “Gluck” and “Piccini”, as opposed to “Gluckisten” and
                  “Piccinisten” (2.43). Such terms can of course be found via a <ref
                     target="search-engl.html?lang=en">full-text search</ref>. Additional categories
                  of named entities (buildings, groups, events, etc.) are planned, pending
                  additional funding.</p>
