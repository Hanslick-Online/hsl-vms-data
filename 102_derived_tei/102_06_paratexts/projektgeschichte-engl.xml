                  Music</emph>)—which during Hanslick’s lifetime appeared in 10 revised editions—
                  Hanslick’s activities as a music critic, and his professorship for the “History
                  and Aesthetics of Musical Art” in Vienna, the earliest such position in
                  German-language academia. Landerer has examined Hanslick’s aesthetics repeatedly
                  since about 1990: his first related study “Bernard Bolzano, Eduard Hanslick und
                  die Geschichte des musikästhetischen Objektivismus” was already published in 1993

               <p>“Hanslick in Context,” presenting the foundation for ensuing research ventures,
                  aimed at critically analyzing the “eclectic” intellectual background of Hanslick’s
                  aesthetics, the genetic factors of which were made transparent from an overarching
                  perspective. Here, we focused on grasping Hanslick’s method of selectively
                  integrating different philosophical discourses as well as his use of textual
                  sources, thereby providing a stable basis for Hanslick scholarship, which has
                  reached strikingly disparate findings in assessing the historical background of
                     <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>. In a first step, we took into account
                  various positions in nineteenth-century aesthetic discourse, whose respective
                  relevance for Hanslick’s reasoning had for the most part been scutinized
                  separately. Considering our hypothesis that Hanslick’s treatise cannot be assigned
                  to any individual philosophical movement and that it is of a quasi-hybrid nature,
                  we analyzed the various sources of his remarks and methods in a broad fashion. In
                  addition to philosophers prominent in Hanslick literature—e.g. Bolzano, Hegel,
                  Herbart, Kant, Vischer, and Zimmermann—we integrated lesser-known figures such as
                  Gutt, Hand, Michaelis, Nägeli, and Weisse into this discursive formation. We
                  moreover examined the parameters of Habsburg education policy and its influence on
                  Hanslick’s aesthetics, which evolved in intimate contact with the Austrian
                  Ministry of Education—led by Count von Thun und Hohenstein—the
                  empirical-formalistic orientation of which also shaped some of his primary
                  doctrines. In addition to Hanslick’s contacts with central figures of the Thun
                  reform, we analyzed the genetic aspects of his aesthetic position. Next to
                  content-related factors, this included questions concerning methodology, e.g.
                  Hanslick’s juridical training and the scientific-theoretical orientation of
                  Austria. In this vein, we were able to integrate established
                  intellectual-historical research methods with current trends towards a broader
                  historical contextualization of Hanslick’s <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>,
                  consequently demonstrating how the genetic context of this book illuminates the
                  intellectual foundations of Hanslick’s aesthetics. We thus made clear how the
                  complex and neglected interplay between philosophical orientations, specific
                  aesthetic traditions, institutional and political settings, and personal relations
                  affected Hanslick’s positions, which did not mature in post-1848 Vienna by
                  historical accident. It is merely against this diversified background that one can
                  hope to grasp the peculiarities of an aesthetic approach, which otherwise defies
                  the proper classification of intellectual coordinates and was devised in a wide
                  field of tension between philosophical, aesthetic, political, scientific, and
                  juridical discourses.</p>

            <div type="inline">
               <p>The project “Studies in the Genesis of Hanslick’s <emph>Vom
                     Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>” continued this work along these lines and expanded
                  our former research approach by including the dimension of the historical
                  evolution of the book itself, which was now investigated from a more systematic
                  perspective. <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> was now considered a dynamic
                  textual corpus, which permits claims regarding “the” aesthetics of Eduard Hanslick
                  merely on basis of detailed genetic studies. The genetic and historical dimension
                  of the text has been analyzed carefully as regards the emergence of this book from
                  pre-publications of 1853 and 1854 (chapters 4, 5, and 6), the chronological as
                  well as logical order of the seven chapters, and the crucial changes in the new
                  editions of 1858 (2nd edition) and 1865 (3rd edition), which are also important
                  regarding Hanslick’s reception in aesthetic discourse. <emph>Vom
                     Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> thus appears neither as an “aphoristic” collection
                  of older texts, nor as a purposefully straightforward monograph, but as a text
                  with a complex argumentative structure, which could only be grasped by means of
                  specific genetic analyses. Our reconstruction of the chronological and logical
                  fabric of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> revealed a surprising chapter
                  sequence (6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 7) that contradicts the familiar sequence of published
                  chapters. We combined this textual problem with the continued examination of
                  relevant contexts, which might have caused the corresponding textual changes and
                  ongoing variation of Hanslick’s arguments in a direct manner. Here, we also
                  focused on Hanslick’s political contexts and institutional affiliations, which
                  proved crucial for the realization of his academic career strategy. Apart from
                  these contextual and textual studies, we moreover included empirical documents
                  (letters, files, etc.), which provided an additional methodological dimension and
                  added depth to our research findings. These (unfortunately rather sparse)
                  documents were furthermore supplemented by a detailed analysis of Hanslick’s
                  personal contacts with prominent nineteenth-century aesthetic theorists (e.g.
                  Robert Zimmermann) and the overall political situation in Vienna; on that front,
                  we considered Hanslick’s activities at Count Thun’s Ministry of Education and its
                  positivistic orientation of particular relevance. Such contexts also illuminated
                  significant modifications in edition 2 of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>,
                  which retracts remnants of romantic aesthetics and reinforces its formalistic
                  orientation.</p>

               <p>The project “Eduard Hanslick’s <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>: An Analysis of the Dynamic
                  Features of the Text and Its Contexts” resumed our treatment of Hanslick’s
                  aesthetic treatise as a <emph>dynamic</emph> corpus of textual material, while 
                  significantly expanding our respective investigation. The period of analysis now covered the
                  years 1848 to 1902 and thereby included all ten versions of <emph>Vom
                  Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> that were edited by Hanslick during his lifetime, as well as
                  the evolution of his arguments in preliminary publications, and 
                  remarks on the themes of his aesthetic treatise in his musical criticism and other textual
                  formats. This substantial expansion of the time frame of our investigation also
                  corresponded to a newly developed and much more comprehensive understanding of the
                  central contexts. We now proceeded to distinguish between the <emph>theoretical</emph> contexts
                  of <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> and its stadiums of continuous development (essential
                  theoretical discourses in a broad sense with the core areas of philosophy,
                  science, music theory) and the <emph>practical</emph> contexts (political setting,
                  institutional affiliations, personal networks). Said theoretical contextual fields
                  were examined in great detail both at the <emph>intra</emph>discursive level (development of
                  the individual discursive formations) and the <emph>inter</emph>discursive level (interaction
                  of the discursive formations with each other). The specific analyses covered 3
                  areas: (a) the historical evolution of Hanslick’s arguments from approx. 1848 to
                  the initial edition of 1854, (b) the genesis, layout, and structure of the
                  arguments within the wording of edition 1 and primarily the conceptual
                  development of central notions within the chapters, and (c) Hanslick’s variation
                  of essential arguments in later editions, up to edition 10 of 1902. This
                  approach was moreover intended to replace a rather static understanding of
                  Hanslick’s aesthetics with a dynamic reading, which could illuminate how
                  elementary references, ideas, and terms are transformed continuously from the
                  individual perspective of Hanslick’s various editions. This very “dynamization” of
                  <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> contributed significantly to a fuller grasp and more
                  appropriate understanding of this essential aesthetic treatise, the historical
                  reception of which frequently overlooks how the dynamic properties of contexts and
                  text(s) deeply affects our interpretation of Hanslick’s concepts and methods.</p>

               <p>The project “Eduard Hanslick's Criticism Between Aesthetics, Journalism, and Scholarship”
                  now shifts the focus of our ongoing research to Hanslick's critical writings while retaining
                  our attention to questions of textual analysis. While scholarship has so far fixated chiefly on analyzing and interpreting 
                  Hanslick’s aesthetics and locating his theoretical reasoning in the context of his
                  age, the current project explores the relation between the various textual genres 
                  of his oeuvre, which remains unclear to this very day. 
                  For if in <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>, for example, Hanslick casts
                  doubt on the frequently postulated correlation between emotion and music from an
                  aesthetic perspective, his critical articles are interspersed with expressive
                  metaphors that at first glance conflict with the maxims of his treatise. Other
                  supposed deviations most likely result from the fact that Hanslick’s activities as
                  a music critic span some sixty years (1844–1904) and developed dynamically over
                  time, while his aesthetic treatise—which he usually altered only slightly in 
                  later revised editions—remained relatively static. The project thus explores the dynamics of these fluid processes and analyzes
                  to what extent Hanslick’s critical writings are compatible with <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph>, 
                  whether genuine contradictions arise or whether
                  later texts could even be read as an elaboration of his aesthetic approach, which
                  has failed to sufficiently theorize essential questions such as the performative
                  nature of music. Here, the project will furthermore reconstruct Hanslick’s
                  criteria for selecting and editing certain essays for the (sometimes thoroughly
                  modified) textual versions provided in his various anthologies, thereby seeking 
                  clarification about shifts in Hanslick’s positions. Moreover, as he
                  conceived of these collected volumes as a “living history” of music in Vienna,
                  they will be cross-read with Hanslick’s conception of academic musical
                  research. This view will then be extended to Hanslick’s concrete language use
                  (expression, speech figures, metaphors, etc.), opening the project to an
                  analysis of cultural, political, and general historical contexts as well as their
                  shifts over, which will become the focal point of a follow-up project.
                  The textual analysis is based on the digital edition of
                  <emph>Vom Musikalisch-Schönen</emph> (2023) and the transcription / TEI annotation of
                  Hanslick’s writings for the <emph>Neue Freie Presse</emph> (1864-1904) and his 12 anthologies,
                  which are being put online in an ongoing process (in development).</p>
